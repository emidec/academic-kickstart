I am an Associate Professor/Reader in Security and Privacy Enhancing Technologies at University College London (UCL), where I currently serve as the Head of the [Information Security Research Group](http://sec.cs.ucl.ac.uk). I am also a Faculty Fellow at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) and a member of the Technology Advisory Panel of the [Information Commissioner's Office](https://ico.org.uk). Before joining UCL in 2013, I was a research scientist at [Xerox PARC](https://www.parc.com). 

In 2005, I received a summa-cum-laude Laurea in Computer Science from the University of Salerno (Italy), and, in 2011, a PhD from the University of California, Irvine, advised by Gene Tsudik. During my PhD, he also spent a few months on research internships at NEC in Heidelberg (2008), INRIA in Grenoble (2009), and Nokia in Lausanne (2010).
